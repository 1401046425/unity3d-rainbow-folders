What you need to configure for each folder item are these fields:
* Folder Name - name of the folder you want to change the icon for.
* Small Icon - your custom icon for the left panel of the project browser (16x16 px)
* Large Icon  - your custom icon for the right panel of the project browser (64x64 px)

Your changes will be applied next time when the project browser will retrieve the focus.
